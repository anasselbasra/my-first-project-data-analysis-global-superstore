This repository contains my very first data analysis project.
Using the Global Superstore dataset, I explore sales, profit, products, and country-level performance through a complete workflow: data acquisition, cleaning, transformation, EDA, and visualization.
The goal was to practice end-to-end analytical thinking and build clear, actionable insights from raw business data.
